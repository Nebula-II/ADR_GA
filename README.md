Automatic dimentionality reduction for multi linear regression analysis using Genetic algorithms


This Approach is a prototype of using genetic algorithm to solve the problem of dimensionality reduction

The inspiration behind this project comes from solving a kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions
